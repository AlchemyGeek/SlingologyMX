# Contributing to SlingologyMX

Thank you for your interest in SlingologyMX.

This project is open source to promote transparency, learning, and experimentation. That said, it is intentionally maintained as a **single-maintainer project**, with a tightly controlled scope and development direction.

---

## Contribution Model

At this time, **external code contributions are not being accepted**.

Specifically:
- Pull requests will not be reviewed or merged
- Architectural or feature changes will not be accepted via PR
- The repository is not governed by a community roadmap

This is a deliberate choice to keep the project focused, coherent, and aligned with real-world operational use.

---

## What *Is* Encouraged

You are very welcome to:

- **Clone** the repository for local use
- **Fork** the project and modify it for your own needs
- **Experiment** with alternative designs or workflows
- **Learn** from the data models, architecture, and implementation
- **Reference** the project in your own work (per the license)

If you build something interesting on top of SlingologyMX, feel free to share it publicly or reference this repository.

## Feedback & Ideas

While code contributions are not accepted, **constructive feedback is welcome**.

You may:
- Open an issue to report bugs
- Open an issue to describe ideas or pain points
- Share observations from real-world use

Please note:
- Opening an issue does not imply that a change will be made
- Feature requests are treated as input, not commitments

---

## Scope & Intent

SlingologyMX is designed as:
- An owner-centric planning and awareness tool
- A metadata layer above paper and scanned records
- A lightweight alternative to fleet-oriented systems

It is **not** intended to become:
- A certified logbook system
- A regulatory authority
- A generalized fleet management platform

These boundaries are intentional.

## Final Note

Aviation rewards clarity, discipline, and restraint.  
This contribution model follows the same principles.

Thank you for respecting the structure and intent of the project.
